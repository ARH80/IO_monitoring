# IO_monitoring in Deep Learning Models
<div style="text-align: right"> 
<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
The operating system lesson project is aimed at exploring the use of CPU and IO in deep learning models
developed using TensorFlow, PyTorch, and OpenCV frameworks. The main steps involved in the project
include bench-marking and monitoring the performance of the models on large datasets, collecting data on
CPU and IO usage, and analyzing the collected data to produce charts and visualizations. The objective of the
project is to gain insights into the performance of these deep learning frameworks, and to identify areas where into
improvements can be made. By analyzing the monitoring data and charts, the project aims to provide insights
how the use of CPU and IO affects the performance of deep learning models, and how different 
frameworks can be optimized for better performance.
